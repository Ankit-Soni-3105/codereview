### ✅ What’s Good
- Function correctly adds two numbers 👍
- Simple and easy to understand logic 💡

### ❌ Needs Improvement
- Unclear function name `abc` -  not descriptive ⚠️
- Global variable `a` is declared but not used within the function - potentially unnecessary 🧩

---

### 🔧 Suggested Improved Version

```js
// Updated: Descriptive function name, removed unused global variable
function add(num1, num2) { // More descriptive parameter names also added
    return num1 + num2;
}
```

🌟 Final Thought

Good foundation!  Descriptive names for functions and variables greatly improve readability and maintainability. Keep up the clean coding! 💪🔥
